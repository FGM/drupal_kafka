   *   Processing is not yet finished. This will allow another process to claim
   *   the item immediately.
   * @throws \Exception
   *   A QueueWorker plugin may throw an exception to indicate there was a
   *   problem. The cron process will log the exception, and leave the item in
   *   the queue to be processed again later.
   * @throws \Drupal\Core\Queue\SuspendQueueException
   *   More specifically, a SuspendQueueException should be thrown when a
   *   QueueWorker plugin is aware that the problem will affect all subsequent
   *   workers of its queue. For example, a callback that makes HTTP requests
   *   may find that the remote server is not responding. The cron process will
   *   behave as with a normal Exception, and in addition will not attempt to
   *   process further items from the current item's queue during the current
   *   cron run.
